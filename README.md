<h3>Workshop Description</h3>
<p>YouTube, Tumblr, Twitter… Have you ever looked at these apps and wondered: Where does the data come from? We explore the hidden places where data lives and how it travels to and from the applications that you use everyday. You’ll learn how to use APIs to get data from apps like Instagram, Fortnite, TikTok, and many others. Then, we’ll make mini websites to fetch data from APIs and display it.</p>
