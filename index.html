							These are the subjects we'll be covering. Servers, Databases, querying data from databases, APIs, 
							and fetching data from APIs. There are so many things to learn about these subjects... we're only 
							going to scratch the surface. But hopefully this workshop will give you enough of a foundation that you'll
							be interested in learning more about application development... and maybe even consider it as a career. 
							Trust me, it's a great job!
							What's NOT in This Workshop: pop-quizzes or tests. You're not going to be quizzed on anything. 
							We're here today just to learn and make things. So don't worry about having to demonstrate anything.
							With that said, let's begin at the beginning...

							<li>There are many different types of servers, like a database server</li>

						<aside class="notes">
							We start off our data journey at the source: the server. You may have heard the term "server" before. But what 
							does it actually mean? A server can be a physical piece of hardware, like your phone or laptop computer. Physical servers 
							look similar to the icon you see here. They're typically stored in special closets or data warehouses where they can 
							be maintained and kept safe.<br/>
							A server can also be virtual, meaning that it exists on the internet, 
							spread out across <em>multiple</em> linked servers. This virtual environment of linked servers is what is known as "the cloud." 
							So whenever you hear someone say "the cloud" in the context of computing, you'll know they're referring to: multiple servers 
							that are linked together and connected to the internet.<br/>

						</ul>
						<aside class="notes">
							Since we're taking about data in this workshop, the type of server that WE are interested 
							in is the database server. A database server contains databases and 
							gives computers ways to access those databases. You can also configure a database server to perform backups of your databases. 
							In other words, it will regularly store copies of the databases. That way, if something were to happen to the original database, you'd have 
							a back up to use instead. Like a spare tire for a car. Now, onto the databases themselves...

							We've learned about the servers where databases live. But what exactly is a database? A database is a system 
							that contains a structured collection of data. There are lots of different kinds of databases, but the one that we use

							Relational data is organized by using tables that contain columns and rows, like a spreadsheet.
							The tables are related by any data that they share. For example, if you and one of your friends both love playing Minecraft, 
							you could say you're related by a common interest. <br/>
							In a similar way, data tables can be related if they share the same data values.

							Data tables should look familiar to you if you've ever used a spreadsheet, or used tables for organizing data 
							in math and science. They have columns that have names and a data type associated with them. And they also
							have rows. Each row in a table represents a set of data, and has a unique ID to distinguish it from all the other rows.

							This is an example of what a relational database table looks like. This table is used for storing information about 
							different fruits that you can buy in the grocery store. Whenever you check out of a grocery store, the computer that 
							the cashier uses will access information from database tables like this one.<br/>
							As you can see, there are 5 rows of data and 4 columns: ID, product name, PLU number, and price.
							When we create a table we have to give each column a name and say what type of data we want it to store. 
							For example, the product name column has a data type called 'variable character' or VarChar for short. This data type is 
							used for storing text characters that can vary in length. The ID column has an integer data type, which is used for storing numbers. <br/>
							And, as you can see, every row contains the information for each fruit. <br/>
							Next we're going to move on to see how we can query data from a database.

							So, how do we talk to a database and ask it to give us the data we want? The database doesn't understand plain English. 
							We can't just type in a command that says "Hi database, can you look in the cats table and give me all the records 
							for female kittens that have stripes?" <br/> If we do that, we'll get an error back from the database, and it will ask us to use

							What you see here is an example of a SQL query that we can give to the database. 
							SQL stands for Structured Query Language, and it's the most commonly used language 
							that software developers use to communicate with databases. SQL queries are written instructions that we give
							to a databases to tell it what to do with the data. In this case we're telling it to SELECT some data for us. <br/>
							Specifically, we want it to select all the values in rows of the cats table where the cat's markings equal 'stripes', 
							and the cat's gender equals 'female' and the cat's age in months is less than or equal to 6.<br/>
