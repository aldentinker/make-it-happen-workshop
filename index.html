						<h1 class="heading">What's in This Workshop</h1>
						<p class="heading-small">You'll be learning about...</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Servers & Databases</li>
							<li>Querying Data</li>
							<li>Application Programming Interface (API)</li>
							<li>Fetching Data from API endpoints</li>
						</ul>
						<aside class="notes">
							These are the subjects we'll be covering. Servers, Databases, querying data from databases, APIs, 
							and fetching data from APIs. There are so many things to learn about these subjects... we're only 
							going to scratch the surface. But hopefully this workshop will give you enough of a foundation that you'll
							be interested in learning more about application development... and maybe even consider it as a career. 
							Trust me, it's a great job!
							What's NOT in This Workshop: pop-quizzes or tests. You're not going to be quizzed on anything. 
							We're here today just to learn and make things. So don't worry about having to demonstrate anything.
							With that said, let's begin at the beginning...

						<h1 class="heading">Servers</h1>
						<p class="heading-small">Once upon a time, there was a server.</p>
						<ul>
							<li>What is a server?</li>
							<li>It can be physical or virtual</li>
							<li>Lives in a server closet, data center, or the cloud</li>
							<li>There are many different types of servers, like a database server</li>
						</ul>
						<aside class="notes">
							We start off our data journey at the source: the server. You may have heard the term "server" before. But what 
							does it actually mean? A server can be a physical piece of hardware, like your phone or laptop computer. Physical servers 
							look similar to the icon you see here. They're typically stored in special closets or data warehouses where they can 
							be maintained and kept safe.<br/>
							A server can also be virtual, meaning that it exists on the internet, 
							spread out across <em>multiple</em> linked servers. This virtual environment of linked servers is what is known as "the cloud." 
							So whenever you hear someone say "the cloud" in the context of computing, you'll know they're referring to: multiple servers 
							that are linked together and connected to the internet.<br/>

						<h1 class="heading">Database Servers</h1>
						<p class="heading-small">What do they do??</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Used for storing and managing databases</li>
							<li>Allows authorized users and applications to access databases</li>
							<li>Can regularly back up data and protect it</li>
						</ul>
						<aside class="notes">
							Since we're taking about data in this workshop, the type of server that WE are interested 
							in is the database server. A database server contains databases and 
							gives computers ways to access those databases. You can also configure a database server to perform backups of your databases. 
							In other words, it will regularly store copies of the databases. That way, if something were to happen to the original, you'd have 
							a back up to use instead. Like a spare tire for a car.

						<h1 class="heading">Databases</h1>
						<p class="heading-small">First stop, the database.</p>
						<ul>
							<li>What is a database?</li>
							<li>It lives on a server</li>
							<li>It's made up of tables</li>
							<li>Like a spreadsheet, it has columns and rows</li>
							<li>Each column has a name to tell us what data is being stored in it, and it has a data type associated with it</li>
						</ul>
