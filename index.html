						Before we get going, we're going to do a quick little ice breaker. And we're going to use the chat box for this. 
						If everyone could write in the chat your first name, along with three positive words to describe yourself. Like... funny.. or brave.
						This is a great exercise whenever you need a little boost of confidence. We all can get a little down on ourselves
						from time to time. And one way to pick yourself up is to write down some things you've accomplished that you're proud of, or 
						some postive traits you have, to remind yourself of your good qualities and the things you're capable of doing.<br/>
						Some nice adjectives go a long way! Great job everyone.

						Hi everyone and WELCOME! You're tuning in to Make It Happen With APIs: The Great Data Journey and the
						Awesomeness of APIs. I'm Alison Tinker, I'm a software developer at SingleStone, and I'm going to be your guide on
						this little data adventure we're embarking on today. First, I want to thank you all for being here. I think it's 
						fantastic that you're taking time out of your week to participate in this wonderful conference. And I really hope you've enjoyed
						your other workshops so far. I especially hope you enjoy this one.<br/>
						We'll be covering a lot of subjects today: Servers, Databases, querying data, APIs, 
						and fetching data from APIs. There are so many things to learn about these subjects... we're only 
						going to scratch the surface. But hopefully this workshop will give you enough of a foundation that you'll
						be interested in learning more about application development... and maybe even consider it as a career. <br/>

						Just want to briefly introduce myself before moving on. Because I think it might be helpful 
						for you to know a little bit about my background. Before I became a software engineer, I was a graphic designer. I made pretty pictures for magazines
						and websites. <br/>
						I actually went to art school, instead of going to a technical school. I don't have a degree in Computer Science. Actually, 
						a lot of my fellow software engineers don't have computer science degrees either, and many of us came from different educational backgrounds.<br/>
						I tell you this because I think most people believe that you need to be good at math and science in order to get a job in
						technology... but that's simply not true. I really hated math when I was in school and I didn't think I was very good at it. That's why I went to art school.
						But I fell in love with computer programming and decided to make a career change. So, all of this is to say... even if you don't think
						you're very good at math or science, you can still be a computer programmer. And if I can do it, YOU can do it.

						<p class="heading-small">Before we begin...</p>
						<ul>
							<li>We'll have breaks for questions. At that point you can ask a questions aloud if you want to.</li>
							<li>Use the Chat to write down questions you think of along the way. I'll come back to them during discussion time.</li>
							<li>There will be 3 informal exercises done in breakout rooms</li>
							<li>Need a break? It's OK!</li>
						</ul>
						<aside class="notes">
							Just a few housekeeping notes before we start, we're going to keep everyone muted until the break for questions.<br/>
							We'll have a couple breaks for reviewing what we've covered and at that point if you want to ask a question aloud,
							you may do so. But you can also just write questions in the chat as we progress, and during the break I'll answer them. 
							You don't have to ask a question aloud if you don't want to. <br/>
							And, of course, if you need to step away for a minute to use the restroom or just stretch and grab a glass of water, please
							go ahead and do that. I know we've all been spending a lot of time on zoom lately. So it's good to get up and get a quick stretch
							if you need to. I've posted the link to my slides in the chat, so you can always go back to a slide to review anything you might've missed.<br/>
							I'm going to be going through some slides to give you an overview of the topics, and we'll jump into various exercises along the way.
							There are 3 exercises and I thought it would be good to try doing those in breakout rooms, that way you can more easily talk to each other
							if you want to and help each other out.<br/>
							I also wanted to make it clear that there are no pop-quizzes or tests. You're not going to be quizzed on anything. 
							We're here today just to learn and make things. So don't worry about having to demonstrate anything.
							With that said, let's begin at the beginning...

						<aside class="notes">
							We start off our data journey at the source: the server. You may have heard the term "server" before. But what 
							does it actually mean? A server can be a physical piece of hardware, like your phone or laptop computer. Physical servers 
							look similar to the icon you see here. They're typically stored in special closets or data warehouses where they can 
							be maintained and kept safe.<br/>
							A server can also be virtual, meaning that it exists on the internet, 
							spread out across <em>multiple</em> linked servers. This virtual environment of linked servers is what is known as "the cloud." 
							So whenever you hear someone say "the cloud" in the context of computing, you'll know they're referring to: multiple servers 
							that are linked together and connected to the internet.<br/>

							Since we're taking about data in this workshop, the type of server that WE are interested 
							in is the database server. A database server contains databases and 
							gives computers ways to access those databases. You can also configure a database server to perform backups of your databases. 
							In other words, it will regularly store copies of the databases. That way, if something were to happen to the original database, you'd have 
							a back up to use instead. Like a spare tire for a car. Now, onto the databases themselves...

							Relational data is organized by using tables that contain columns and rows, like a spreadsheet.
							The tables are related by any data that they share. For example, if you and one of your friends both love playing Minecraft, 
							you could say you're related by a common interest. <br/>
							In a similar way, data tables can be related if they share the same data values.

							This is an example of what a relational database table looks like. This table is used for storing information about 
							different fruits that you can buy in the grocery store. Whenever you check out of a grocery store, the computer that 
							the cashier uses will access information from database tables like this one.<br/>
							As you can see, there are 5 rows of data and 4 columns: ID, product name, PLU number, and price.
							When we create a table we have to give each column a name and say what type of data we want it to store. 
							For example, the product name column has a data type called 'variable character' or VarChar for short. This data type is 
							used for storing text characters that can vary in length. The ID column has an integer data type, which is used for storing numbers. <br/>
							And, as you can see, every row contains the information for each fruit. <br/>
							Next we're going to move on to see how we can query data from a database.

							What you see here is an example of a SQL query that we can give to the database. 
							SQL stands for Structured Query Language, and it's the most commonly used language 
							that software developers use to communicate with databases. SQL queries are written instructions that we give
							to a databases to tell it what to do with the data. In this case we're telling it to SELECT some data for us. <br/>
							Specifically, we want it to select all the values in rows of the cats table where the cat's markings equal 'stripes', 
							and the cat's gender equals 'female' and the cat's age in months is less than or equal to 6.<br/>

							<li>Click 'Run' again!</li>
							<li>Bonus: try adding more data and/or changing your query to see what happens.</li>
						</ol>
						<aside class="notes">
							Now we're actually going to write some SQL! We're goin gto do this in an online app that simulates
							a database and provides an interface for making data queries.<br/>
							What I'm going to do is demonstrate the exercise, and then we
							can all go into break out rooms and you can try it for yourselves. I'll post the instructions in the chat so you can refer back to them.<br/>
							I'm going to go to this link, and click on the link at the top that says 'Fork'. This will give you a copy of the original page, and this will allow you
							to make changes without affecting the original page. You can always go back to the original link I posted 
							and make another fork if you want to start over.<br/>
							Ok, so now that we have a forked copy, let's look over here on the left side. We have some SQL statements. 
							These statements create 2 new database tables, and then these statements insert data into those tables. On the right side we have the SQL query that 
							selects the data and returns it to us. <br>
							Let's try running the program and see what happens. As you can see, it returns the data that we've asked for. This statement is saying "Give me
							all the data in the favorite_foods table." And that's exactly what it did.
							So, let's try inserting some new data and then querying it. <br/>
							Go to the last statement and replace the word 'avocado' with a different food. And replace the description that says 'delicious in a salad'
							with a different description. Make sure to keep the single quotes around the values. Now, click Run again. You should see your new food appear in the chart.<br/>
							Now, let's change our query to get only the food that we just added. All we have to do is add on to the query we already have.
							We want to add the following: WHERE food_name = 'avocado'.
							Then hit Run again, you should now see only the new food that you added to the table. Ok, now that I've done it, I want you guys to try it.
							We're going to go into break out rooms now. I'll pop in at some point and see how you're getting on, and see if you have any questions.

							So we’ve learned how to query a databases that we have access to, but what if I wanted to get data from a database 
							that I don't have direct access to? What if I wanted to get data from Instagram's database? Or Facebook's database?
							They don't give access to their database, because that would be unsafe. They can't let random people do whatever they want to their user data.</br>
							So instead, they create an API. API stands for Application Programming Interface. <br/>
							An API is an application that acts as a <em>messenger</em> between a database and other applications.
							An application makes a request to the API for some data, the API fetches the data from the database, and then returns it to those applications. 
							This allows companies like Facebook and Instagram to control what data people can have access to, and to control what they can do with that data.
							Often, it will also act like a translator between the database and other applications, because it can format the data into a structure that’s easier for other applications to use. 
							Next we're going to watch a quick video that uses a really good analogy to describe what an API does.

							Now we arrive at our last exercise! We're going to use an app called code sandbox that let's us fetch data from different API endpoints
							and display the data on a page. Again, I'm going to demo this and then we're going to use break out groups so you can try it out.

							<li>Servers contain databases</li>
							<li>Databases contain tables that hold our data</li>
							<li>We can use SQL to change the data in a table, and to get data back</li>
							<li>APIs are applications that take data to and from a database for us</li>
							<li>We can use API endpoints to GET, POST, UPDATE, and DELETE data</li>

							Wow guys, we've reached the end of our data journey. This is just a quick recap of everything we've learned.
